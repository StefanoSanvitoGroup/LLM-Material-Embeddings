## Create Embeddings

The jupyter notebook in the "Embeddings" folder loads a given LLM model using the huggingface transformers library and takes the final embedding layer. It will then compare the rankings of different quasi-contextualizations and queries with the ground truth and generate a heat map as can be found in ADD DOI HERE.
